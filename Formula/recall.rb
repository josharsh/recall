      ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Setup (recommended):
        Run this command to automatically configure your .zshrc:
          recall-setup

      üìù Manual Setup:
        Add to your ~/.zshrc:
          source $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_recall_loader

        Or if you use Oh My Zsh, add to plugins array:
          plugins=(... recall)

      üîÑ Then restart your terminal or run:
        source ~/.zshrc

      üöÄ Quick start:
        recall              # Show project insights
        recall stats        # Detailed statistics
        recall suggest      # Get alias suggestions
        recall help         # Full documentation
